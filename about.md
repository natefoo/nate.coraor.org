lp0 on fire: Adventures in modern UNIX/Linux system administration.

In my day job, I am a system administrator for the [Galaxy Project][galaxy] in the [Nekrutenko Lab][nekrut] at [Penn
State University][psu]. Most notably, I architect and maintain the deployment of [usegalaxy.org][usegalaxy], a free
service integrating compute resources across the country.

Back in the day, I ran Solaris, leaving me with an old(ish) school UNIX bent and a soft spot for illumos. Now I do
stuff like "DevOps" and "Infrastructure as Code", but you won't hear me say it. At the end of the day, it's all just
system administration.
