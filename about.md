lp0 on fire: Adventures in modern UNIX/Linux system administration.

In my day job, I am a system administrator for the [Galaxy Project][galaxy] in the [Nekrutenko Lab][nekrut] at [Penn
State University][psu]. Most notably, I architect and maintain the deployment of [usegalaxy.org][usegalaxy], a free
service integrating compute resources across the country.

Back in the day, I ran [Solaris][solaris], leaving me with an old(ish) school UNIX bent and a soft spot for
[illumos][illumos], especially [SmartOS][smartos]. Now they call what I do "[DevOps][devops]" and "[Infrastructure as
Code][iac]", but at the end of the day, it's all just system administration.

Any views expressed on this site are my own, and are **not** the views of my employer or projects/teams of which I am a
member.
